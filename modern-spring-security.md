You need to secure REST APIs in your Spring Boot application and you've heard that Spring Security is the go-to solution. You do a quick search and are instantly inundated by results that mention terms like OAuth2, JWT, OpenID Connect, Resource Servers, and Authorization Servers. You are not sure what any of these things are and you donâ€™t know where to start. On top of this all of the examples you find seem like a regurgitation of the previous tutorial and they all seem complicated and outdated. There has to be an easier solution.

There is an easier solution and that's by using modern Spring Security best practices along with understanding some of the fundamental core concepts. In this hands-on session, you will secure a REST API using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and understand how to write a Spring Security Configuration from scratch. You will learn how authentication and authorization work and we will introduce you to topics like Authorization and Resource servers and what they are used for.
