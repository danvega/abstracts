# Spring Boot 3: Maximizing Runtime Efficiency and Developer Experience

This presentation highlights several new and intriguing features in Spring Boot 3.0 and later versions. A significant focus in Spring Boot 3.x is enhancing runtime efficiency. We'll delve into AOT (Ahead of Time) compilation, crucial for creating native images with GraalVM. Spring Boot 3.2 included comprehensive support for the much-anticipated JDK feature, Virtual Threads, promising considerable scalability benefits for traditional blocking MVC applications. Lastly, you'll learn about the initial support for Project CRaC, aimed at improving startup times.

Apart from runtime efficiency we will cover another major theme in the latest releases of Spring Framework and Spring Boot and that is Developer Experience. The new Docker Compose Module and Testcontainers at development time features make it easier to hit the ground running. The new Client Abstractions give developers the tools they need to be productive.

If we are going to discuss new features, we should also spend some time talking about how to upgrade your 2.x applications to Spring Boot 3.x and the tools available in the ecosystem to help automate this process. By the end of this presentation, you will be excited about the offerings of Spring Framework 6.x and Spring Boot 3.x, and equipped with the knowledge to perform an upgrade.
