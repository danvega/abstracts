# Practical AI Integration with Java: A Hands-On Workshop

In today's tech landscape, incorporating AI capabilities has become essential for modern applications. This comprehensive 4-hour workshop equips Java developers with practical skills needed to implement powerful AI features in their applications. Through a combination of theory and hands-on coding, you'll learn to build sophisticated AI integrations using familiar Java paradigms.

Starting with foundational concepts, we'll progress to implementing specific AI capabilities including natural language processing, computer vision, and interactive chatbots. The workshop explores advanced techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhanced context awareness, and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for effective AI orchestration. Using Spring AI's powerful abstractions, you'll learn how to write model-agnostic code that works seamlessly with both cloud-based and local AI models, giving you the flexibility to choose the right solution for your specific needs.

Through guided exercises, you'll gain hands-on experience with setting up AI development environments, integrating various AI capabilities into your applications, and building intelligent features that can process text, images, and audio using both local and cloud-based models.
