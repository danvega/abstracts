# Getting Started with Spring

If you’re a Java developer and want to learn about the most popular frameworks ever created this session is for you. You are going to learn what Spring is used for and how it can make you a more productive developer. It does this by providing you with the infrastructure to build enterprise-ready applications and allowing you to focus on features.

After an introduction to Spring, you will get familiar with the framework by building out a practical application. Along the way, you will learn about the core principles of Spring like Inversion of Control (IoC), dependency injection, beans, application context, and more.

Building a new application isn’t much use if you can’t get it to production. You will learn about the different approaches to moving your application to the greatest place on the planet, production!  By the end of this session, you will have what you need to start building enterprise-grade applications with Spring.
