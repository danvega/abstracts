# Full-Stack Java Development with Spring Boot

Are you interested in building full-stack web applications with Spring Boot? If so, this session is going to give you everything you need to get started. You will learn some of the different approaches to building full-stack applications and the pros and cons of each.

First, we will look at how to use a frontend framework like Vue but this could be any component-based framework like React, Svelt, or even Vanilla JavaScript. Vue is a progressive framework and will allow you to incrementally adopt it in your Java applications as your needs grow.

Next, we will look at how to build a monolith application where you end up with a single deployable JAR. Finally, if your frontend and backend teams are separate, we will look at a solution for you.
When you leave this session, youâ€™ll have everything you need to start building full-stack web applications with Spring Boot.

**Length: 45-60 minutes**

This presentation can also be expanded into a 2-8 hour workshop to include:

- Deep dive Vue
