# Spring for GrqphQL

In a world where multiple applications and clients are calling your APIs, you end up having to create custom endpoints for different views of your data. What if you could provide fewer endpoints and let the consumer decide on which data they need.

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

In this session, you will learn what GraphQL is and why you should consider it in your next project. You will learn how to use GraphQL in your Spring Boot applications by leveraging the Spring for GraphQL project. By the end of this session, you will understand how to stand up a GraphQL endpoint and request the data you need, and nothing more.
