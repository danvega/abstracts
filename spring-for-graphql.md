# Give your APIs a REST and make the move to GraphQL

GraphQL is a declarative query language that allows you to retrieve data from an application's backend with ease. It provides a comprehensive and clear description of the data in your API, giving you the power to only ask for what you need and nothing more. It makes it easy to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools.

In this talk, we will cover the basics of GraphQL and how it differs from traditional RESTful API architectures. We will examine the syntactical and structural aspects of GraphQL queries, and investigate the libraries and tools accessible for interfacing GraphQL in Vue. By the end of this talk, you will have a solid understanding of how to start using GraphQL in your next Vue application and be able to take advantage of its many benefits.
