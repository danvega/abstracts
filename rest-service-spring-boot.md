# Introduction to building REST services with Spring Boot

Long gone are the days of verbose & complicated web development in Java. The Spring Framework has become the world's most popular Java Framework thanks to its focus on speed, simplicity, and productivity.

In almost every application youâ€™re building these days there needs to be a mechanism for exchanging data with other services. This is the same no matter what architecture you choose from Monolithic to Distributed. One approach to sharing data between services is by using synchronous communication via REST Services.

REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer and it's a standard for exposing your API in a uniform and stateless manner. Before you begin writing REST services you need to learn the underlying principles such as Resources, HTTP Verbs, Headers & status codes.

In this session, you will learn the basics of how to create a new web application in Spring Boot, with the focus on building REST APIs. To accomplish that you will need to learn the mechanics of a RestController and the annotations you will encounter. You will also learn how to ensure data integrity by validating the data being passed into your API. By the end of this presentation, you will be able to stand up a CRUD API.

**Length:** 45-60 Minutes

This presentation can also be expanded into a 2-8 hour workshop to include:

- Deeper dive into data validation
- Data persistence
- Testing
- REST API documentation
