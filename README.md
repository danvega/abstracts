# Abstracts

This repository contains abstracts for talks I can give. The format depends on the talk and the details are in each of the abstracts. Generally these talks can be used for:

- Live Coding Sessions
- User Group Meetups
- Conferences
- Workshops

If you're interested in having me speak at your event please reach out to me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/therealdanvega).
