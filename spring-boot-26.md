# What's new in Spring Boot 2.6

A new major version of Spring Boot is released every 6 months or so. When a new version is released a set of release notes are published along with it. The release notes contain specific information about how to upgrade from a previous version and what's new & noteworthy.

What they don't contain are in depth examples of how to use the new features. This presentation aims to fill the void by showing you some of the major changes by example. The first thing you need to understand is how to upgrade your Spring Boot 2.5 application to Spring Boot 2.6. You will learn the following features by building a 2.5.9 application and upgrading it to 2.6:

- Release Versioning
- Deprecations
- Circular References
- Path Matching Strategy for Spring MVC
- Actuator Env InfoContributor
- Application Startup Steps
- Records & `@ConfigurationProperties`

Now that you have your application upgraded it's time to take advantage of the new features. You will learn what's new by workng through examples that cover the following:

- Reactive Server Session Properties
- Build Info Property Exclusion
- SameSite Cookie Attribute
- Pluggable Sanitization Rules
- Java Runtime Information
- WebTestClient for Spring MVC
- Metrics Support
- Docker Image Building Support

A great way to stay caught up with what is changing in Spring Boot is to review the release notes for each major release. A better way is to learn by example and that is exactly what you will do in this presentation.
