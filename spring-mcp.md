# Building AI-Enabled Spring Applications with Model Context Protocol (MCP) 

As Large Language Models (LLMs) revolutionize application development, Java/Spring developers face a critical challenge: how to securely and efficiently connect these AI models with enterprise data and tools. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) offers a practical solution by providing a standardized approach for integrating AI capabilities into Spring applications while maintaining enterprise-grade security and scalability.

Through live coding demonstrations, we'll explore how to leverage Spring AI MCP to build powerful AI-enabled applications. Starting with basic setup and configuration, we'll progress to building custom MCP servers using Spring Boot and create practical features that combine the power of LLMs with Spring's robust ecosystem. You'll see firsthand how to connect your Spring applications to Claude Desktop and other AI tools while maintaining control over your data and infrastructure.

Attendees will leave this session with everything needed to start implementing MCP in their Spring projects: working code examples, best practices for secure AI integration, patterns for building custom MCP servers, and practical strategies for enhancing existing applications with AI capabilities. Whether you're new to AI integration or looking to standardize your approach across the enterprise, you'll gain actionable insights to immediately improve your AI development workflow.
