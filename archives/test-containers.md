# Level Up Your Integration Testing With Testcontainers

Traditional approaches to integration testing—using shared, local, or in-memory databases—fall short for today's modern developer.
Developers today are building cloud native distributed microservices and taking advantage of a rich variety of backing services. This explosion of applications and backing services introduces new challenges in creating the necessary environments for integration testing. To be useful and effective, these environments must be easy to create and they must resemble production as closely as possible. New solutions are needed to make this need a reality.

Enter Testcontainers!

Testcontainers is a Java library that supports JUnit tests and makes it incredibly easy to create lightweight, throwaway instances of common databases, Selenium web browsers, or anything else that can run in a Docker container.

In this talk, you will learn when and how to use Testcontainers. We will cover the fundamentals and walk through a step-by-step example using a Spring Boot application that we build from scratch. As a bonus, we'll highlight some new features in Spring Boot 3.0 along the way!
